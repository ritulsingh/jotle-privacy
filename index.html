            <p><span class="emoji">‚ú®</span> <strong>Jotle - Joy of Thoughtful Lists and Entries</strong> is a minimalist note-taking application created with love by Ritulsingh in Delhi, India. We believe that your thoughts deserve a safe space to grow, which is why we've designed Jotle with your privacy as our top priority.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2><span class="emoji">üîí</span> Your Data Stays With You</h2>
        <p>Here's something to feel good about: Jotle <strong>never</strong> collects, stores, or shares any of your personal information. Every note, list, and entry you create lives exclusively on your device. Your thoughts remain yours and yours alone!</p>
        
        <h2><span class="emoji">üì±</span> Mindful Permissions</h2>
        <p>Jotle only asks for what it needs to serve you better. When we request access to your device's storage, it's solely so you can save and retrieve your notes. No hidden agendas, just straightforward functionality that respects your privacy.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="emoji">üõ°Ô∏è</span> No Third Parties Invited</h2>
        <p>We don't believe in sharing your data with third parties, which is why Jotle doesn't use any external analytics, advertising networks, or services that might compromise your privacy. It's just you and your notes in a secure environment.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="emoji">üë∂</span> Child-Friendly Environment</h2>
        <p>We care about protecting younger users. Jotle is designed to be used by anyone, and we take special care not to collect information from children under 13. Creating a safe digital environment for all is important to us.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="emoji">üîç</span> No External Links</h2>
        <p>Jotle keeps it simple by not including links to external websites. Should we add any in the future, they'll be clearly marked, and we'll encourage you to review their privacy practices too.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="emoji">üîÑ</span> Evolving Together</h2>
        <p>As Jotle grows, this policy may occasionally be updated. We'll always post changes here with a new "Last Updated" date, maintaining our commitment to transparency.</p>
